# Compas dansant (dancing dividers)

A simple Purescript application that generates random drawings using HTML Canvas.

While going through the Purescript book and in particular the [Canvas Graphics chapter](https://book.purescript.org/chapter9.html) I decided to play a bit with the provided [HTML Canvas API in Purescript](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-canvas/3.0.0/docs/Graphics.Canvas) and hopefully learn a bit in the process.
